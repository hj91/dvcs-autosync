Description: Automatically synchronize distributed version control repositories
 dvcs-autosync is an open source replacement for Dropbox/Wuala/Box.net/etc. 
 based on distributed version control systems (DVCS). It offers nearly 
 instantaneous mutual updates when a file is added or changed on one side but 
 with the added benefit of (local, distributed) versioning and that it does 
 not rely on a centralized service provider, but can be used with any DVCS 
 hosting option including a completely separate server.
 .
 Synchronization of directories is based on DVCS repositories. Git is used for 
 main development and is being tested most thoroughly as the backend storage, 
 but other DVCS such as Mercurial are also supported. dvcs-autosync is 
 comparable to SparkleShare in terms of overall aim, but takes a more 
 minimalistic approach. A single Python script monitors the configured 
 directory for live changes, commits these changes to the DVCS (such as git) 
 and synchronizes with other instances using XMPP messages.
